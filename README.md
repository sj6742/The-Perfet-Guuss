# The Perfect Guess

## Description
The Number Guessing Game is a simple Python program where the player tries to guess a randomly chosen number within a given range. The program provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, helping the player refine their guesses until they find the correct number.

## Features
- Random number generation within a specified range
- User input for guessing the number
- Feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low
- Tracks the number of attempts taken to guess correctly
- Option to play again after a correct guess

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## How to Run the Game
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the project files.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
4. Run the following command:
   ```sh
   python number_guessing_game.py
   ```

## How to Play
1. The program selects a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).
2. You enter your guess.
3. The program tells you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct.
4. If incorrect, you keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. The game displays the number of attempts you took to guess correctly.
6. You can choose to play again or exit.

## Example Output
```
Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 50
Too high! Try again.
Guess a number: 25
Too low! Try again.
Guess a number: 37
Congratulations! You guessed the number in 3 attempts.
Do you want to play again? (yes/no)
```

## Customization
- Modify the range of numbers by changing the values in the random number generator.
- Add a difficulty setting to adjust the number of attempts allowed.
- Implement a scoring system based on the number of attempts taken.
